// * For versioning, the fourth digit represents the days from the build date to the 
//   day of the first release (2/15/2015).
// * The third digit is increased when a small feature is added.
// * The second digit is increased when a component is added to the whole package.
// * The first digit is increase when a set of components planned yearly are completed.
// * The nuget package version shall be the same with the assembly version.
// * Each new release brought up by the nuget package forces re-compile for 
//   the applications and components which depends on the .NET Commons library.
// * The build number only changes when a new nuget package is uploaded. If there are more than 
//   one upload in one day, the build number is increased by one. If next few days, another upload happens,
//   build number is increased by one if the number of days to the first day is less than or 
//   equal to the build number.
// * TODO: Automated version strategy will be developed in future.
